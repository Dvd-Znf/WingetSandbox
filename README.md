## Why manualy verify like this when you can use an autotest script?
I made this repo because I needed to manually check some packages and while I like automation sometimes less is more.  
## How to use?
```
PS: cd Desktop
PS: git clone   
PS: WindowsSandbox WingetSandbox\WingetSanbox.wsb  
```
### The installation is now portable so you can move the repo anywhere, even outside of your pc (Ex. on a NAS)
